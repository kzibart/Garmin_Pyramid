Garmin Connect IQ Game Pyramid

It's Pyramid Solitaire!  Play anywhere, on the go!  And best of all, it's completely free!

Pyramid is a fun solo card game.  Match cards that add up to 13 to clear the pyramid!  Jacks are 11, Queens are 12, and Kings are 13 and can be removed by themselves.  You can only select "free" cards with no other cards covering them, unless the only card coving it is the one you're matching with.  Can you clear the entire pyramid?

Instructions:
Tap on a free card in the pyramid or in the play stack to select it.
Then tap another card to match with it.
Tap on the deck to draw a new card.
Tap the empty deck to reload it from the play stack.
Tap New to start a new game.
Press Menu to change settings or view statistics.
